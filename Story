There once was a town and a frest connected to the town.
None used to go to the forest but one day James had a very important work and had to cross the forest with his two sons Harry & James. 
One tiger came twards them and the two kids got scared but james intellingently told the kids not to fight for th treat of tiger and share the tiger. 
Listening this Tiger ran away in terror and told all this to the wolf the wolf said not to worry and he took thee tiger back to james 
and promised him that if James did the same thing again the tiger could eat him. 
They went to james and James told the wolf that he had promised James,
to get three tigers for him but he only got one listening this the tiger got angry and slayed the wolf.  
From that time all the people of town went through the forest happily.
